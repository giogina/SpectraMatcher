# Quick start guide

SpectraMatcher is a tool for displaying and analyzing experimental and computed vibronic spectra.

## Installation

A Windows installation file is available [here](../installer/SpectraMatcher-setup.exe). Download this .exe and click through the installation wizard. No special permissions are necessary. It is recommended to keep the default installation directory.

You may use up or down arrow keys to select a recent project, and hit enter to open it. Pressing Escape closes the dashbaord.
