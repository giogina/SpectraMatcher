# Spectrum Matching

## Composite Spectrum

## Table of peak assignments

Upon pressing the "Show match assignments" button in the "Match settings" section, a table is displayed below the plot, listing the experimental peak positions and intensities, together with the assigned computed peak intensity, position, and information about the contributing transitions.

Only transitions that are labeled in the plot are listed in this table, since otherwise, for large molecules, the table would become too large.\
Adjust the label thresholds to achieve the desired number of listed transitions.

Hovering over a line in the match table highlights the corresponding assingment line in the plot above.
