# Export of Results

Once your spectra are aligned and peak matching is complete, SpectraMatcher lets you export your results in formats ready for publication or further analysis.

## Exporting the Assignment Table

The table of matched peaks â€” including intensities, transition labels, and wavenumbers â€” can be exported in several formats:

- **.txt** (tab-separated plain text) for spreadsheet analysis or scripting
- **.docx** (Word) for easy insertion into reports or manuscripts
- **.tex** (LaTeX) for direct inclusion in scientific publications

Choose the format in the drop-down menu in the **Match settings** panel, then click **Copy table** to copy the data to your clipboard, ready to paste into your text editor of choice.

> ðŸ’¡ The copying functionality uses the clipboard tool installed on your system. On linux, this requires e.g. xclip to be installed â€” this is done automatically by SpectraMatcher's installation script.

The plain-text table is kept minimally formatted, to facilitate further analysis, e.g. in spreadsheet software.
The Word and LaTeX tables feature properly aligned columns and math-mode formatting for vibrational mode labels:

> ðŸ’¡ Ensure you use `\usepackage{booktabs}` in your preamble to enable proper formatting of the LaTeX table. Alternatively, replace the `\toprule` etc. by `\hline` commands.

## Exporting Computed Spectra as Data

To export the computed spectrum data (e.g., the current composite spectrum), open the **Composite Spectrum** dropdown in the top right and click **Copy**. This copies the spectrum as tab-separated values:

```
wavenumber[int]    intensity[rel]
1345.0             0.12
1401.2             0.31
...
```

You can paste this into a spreadsheet, plotting tool, or save it to a `.txt` file.

## Saving Annotated Screenshots

To save a snapshot of the current plot â€” including spectrum overlays, peak matches, and annotations â€” use the **Save Screenshot** button in the plot panel toolbar.

This produces a high-resolution `.png` image suitable for presentations or publication figures.

## Where the Files Go

- Screenshots and exported tables are saved in the same directory as your `.smp` project file.
- Composite spectra are copied to the clipboard and can be saved manually.
